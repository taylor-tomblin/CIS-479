# Description: This program solves the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic.
# The program reads the initial and goal states of the puzzle from a file and outputs the solution to the console.
# The program also outputs the number of nodes expanded and the number of nodes in the open list at the end of the search.
