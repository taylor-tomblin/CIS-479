Description: This program solves the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic.
The program reads the initial and goal states of the puzzle from a file and outputs the solution to the console.
The program also outputs the number of nodes expanded and the number of nodes in the open list at the end of the search.
